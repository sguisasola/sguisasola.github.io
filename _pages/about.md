Hi! I’m Santiago.

My research is on creativity, collaboration, and coordination within multi-agent systems. I've worked on the theoretical aspects of this investigation using game theory. Through musical improvisations conducted on networks, I aimed to isolate and understand the effects of information flow on these fundamental aspects. Additionally, I've documented a method for interactive media, providing a platform for further experimentation in this intriguing area of work.

Besides my research, I have been actively involved in education since my graduate studies, where I had the privilege to teach eight courses across two univerities and departments. I have also worked with the education team at the Santa Fe Institute on various online and in-person programs.
