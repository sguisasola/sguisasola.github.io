Hi! Iâ€™m Santiago. I received my PhD in Mathematical Behavioral Sciences from the University of California, Irvine.

I have been actively involved in education since my graduate studies, where I led ten classes. I have also worked with the education team at the <a href="https://santafe.edu">Santa Fe Institute</a> on various online and in-person programs since 2018.

My research is on creativity, collaboration, and coordination within multi-agent systems. I've worked on the theoretical aspects of this investigation using game theory. Through musical improvisations conducted on networks, I aimed to isolate and understand the effects of information flow on these fundamental aspects. Additionally, I've documented a method for interactive media, providing a platform for further experimentation in this intriguing area of work.
