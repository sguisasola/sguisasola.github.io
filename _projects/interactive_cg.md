I documented the Videolab/Klak environment in Unity during my postdoctoral research at the Computer Graphics Laboratory (<a href="http://visgraf.impa.br">Visgraf</a>) of the <a href="https://impa.br">Instituto de Matem√°tica Pura e Aplicada</a> in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Videolab/Klak is a simple and powerful Unity package to build virtual collaborative environments for computer graphics and mixed media.

Part of my work was to survey available tools, methods, and software environments to enable future variations of the <a href="../network_improv">networked improvisations</a> that can account for other instances of creativity, collaboration, and coordination in multi-agent systems --- not just music. Videolab/Klak was the perfect candidate.

Hence, the goal of this documentation was two-fold: (1) sow the seed for future investigations into collaborative multi-agent systems, (2) document a powerful but obscure programming environment for creating multimedia art.
