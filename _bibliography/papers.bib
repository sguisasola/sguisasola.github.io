  title={With Potential Games, Which Outcome Is Better?},
  author={Guisasola, Santiago and Saari, Don},
  abstract={
  Lower one- or two-dimensional coordination, or potential games, are popularly used to model interactive behavior, such as innovation diffusion and cultural evolution. Typically, this involves determining the “better” of competing solutions. However, examples have demonstrated that different measures of a “good” choice can lead to conflicting conclusions; a fact that reflects the history of game theory in equilibrium selection. This behavior is totally explained while extending the analysis to the full seven-dimensional class of potential games, which includes coordination games.

  title={Towards a Mathematical Theory of Group Creativity and Collaboration},
  author={Guisasola, Santiago},
  abstract={
  This dissertation is a stepping stone into an in-depth study of group creativity. The foundation for this work concerns collective musical improvisation, and the project grew from an experiment with improvising musicians on networks of controlled listening. This experiment served as a source for intuition and its many sessions records of the unfolding creative and collaborative process in real-time.
A literature review of related themes suggested potential games as a starting point for the theoretical modeling due to their embodiment of the many facets of coordination, undeniably a strong force in music and group creativity. The current status of these games proved to be insufficient for the goal of this thesis. For this reason, the beginning of this thesis, chapter 2, provides a fairly complete picture of 2-strategy potential games for any number of agents, and for 2-agent 3-strategy games.
In chapter 3, to show the power of the coordinate system developed for potential games in chapter 2, issues in the literature involving possible conflicts between measures of “good” group outcomes are elucidated. Finally, in chapter 4, the collective improvisation experiment is described followed by models of an improvising trio, an orchestra, and the collective generation of information. Admittedly, the work in chapter 4 is still in progress, and will be improved on in the years to come.},
